# Hierarchical-Clustering
Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised method that builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) of nested clusters. Starting with each point as its own cluster, it iteratively merges the closest pairs (agglomerative) or splits clusters (divisive) based on distance, revealing relationships at multiple levels.
